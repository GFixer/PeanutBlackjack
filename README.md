# PeanutBlackjack
This is a tiny game program set to model the card game blackjack.

It includes the very minimum functionality.
It was created to try out the PyQt5 toolkit and to try implementing classes and objects.

The functionality is limited, it would be a good exercise to update the game with more functions.
